# Learning-C

This repository will be used to facilitate and track my learning progress
in the C programming language. I intend to slowly make my way through
three major resources in an attempt to better understand the language. 

These resources will include: 

* The C Programming Language Second Edition (K & R)
* C Programming A Modern Approach Second Edition (K.N.King)
* Expert C Programming Deep C Secrets (Peter Van Der Linden)

Each one of these resources will be split into directories based on chapters
,then exercises, a README Documenting the things learned through each 
chapter, and finally any side programs I may have written while reading that
chapter. 

My hope is this will not only be a resource to me now and in the future, but
also to others in their journey to learning the C Programming language.
As I progress through this goal I will attempt to update this README with 
additional resources that I have found helpful.
